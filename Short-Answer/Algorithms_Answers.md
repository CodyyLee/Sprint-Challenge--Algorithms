#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Cubic


b) Quadratic


c) Exponential

## Exercise II

start = 0
middle = (start + end) // 2
end = len(n) - 1

while True:
  if difference of position in start and middle is 1 or end and middle is 1:
    not found
  else if middle is f:
    return f
  else if middle is > f:
    make end = middle
  else:
    make start = middle


I THINK IT IS O(log n) ?
